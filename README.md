# gosha256

## About

Very simple quick hack to check of the go calculation of a SHA256 digest results the same value as the usual CLI commands such as `shasum -a 256` or `sha256sum`.

It is kept in a repository to easily do a retest if required.

Currently, March 2022, the compiled binary outputs the same string as the stanard CLI commands.
